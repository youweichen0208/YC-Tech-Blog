# Greedy Algorithm

## What is Greedy Algorithm

A greedy algorithm makes the locally optimal choice at each decision point with the hope that these local choices will lead to a global optimum. It does not consider the effects of its current decision on future decisions. It's called "greedy" because it takes the best immediate advantage without thinking ahead.

## Greedy Algorithm concept:

- The most common thing associated with greedy algorithm is **Sorting**.

- Greedy refers to **A way of approaching problems**

- The most common characteristic greedy problems have is **Problem is asking for the max/min of something**
