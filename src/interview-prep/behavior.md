# Behavioral Questions

## what is the STAR method?

The STAR method is an interview technique that gives us a straightforward format we can use to tell a story by laying out the situation, task, action, and result.

- **Situation**: Set the scene and give the necessary details of our example.
- **Task**: Describe what our responsibility was in that situation
- **Action**: Explain exactly what steps I took to address it.
- **Result**: share what outcomes my actions achieved.

## Self-introduction:

Good morning/afternoon/evening, my name is Youwei Chen. I was a master student studying computer science in Virginia Tech, and I just graduated this December. I am a passionate person in programming. Back in 2019, I got an internship in Tencent and was assigned a couple of testing and API documentation tasks. I used Swagger2 to build and document the API. For the personal projects, I have also done a couple of online ecommerce websites to improve my technical skills. I am also very good at Java. Java is my first language I learned since I started programming. So I think I am a great fit for this Java batch.

## talk about the project:

The most recent/proudest project I have done is I worked with the team to build a second-hand online ecommerce website for Virginia Tech students and local residents in Blacksburg. As we know the price of the second hand products are always much lower than their counterparts, so me and my team believe that second hand products can have the potential to be the top choice for students. I was assigned to be the frontend developer in the project. I used React as the frontend framework. I had a good communication with the backend developers and we successfully achieved client and server integration. The customers can both be the sellers and buyers on our website. They can post the products to the website.
