Each of these applications is a separate process, and they are all running concurrently, each in its own memory space. The operating system manages these processes, scheduling CPU time for each one and switching between them quickly enough that it appears to the user that they are all running simultaneously.</p><h3 id="thread-based-multitasking" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#thread-based-multitasking" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Thread-based multitasking</h3><p>Allows parts of the same program to run concurrently. For example, a web server might spawn a new thread for each incoming client request. This allows the server to handle multiple requests concurrently, even if it&#39;s in the middle of processing a request. Each thread runs in the same memory space (the server process), but operates independently, handling its own client request.</p><h3 id="threads-vs-process" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#threads-vs-process" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Threads vs Process:</h3><ul><li>Threads in the same program share the same address in memory</li><li>Context Switching between threads is usually less expensive than between processes.</li></ul><h2 id="threads" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#threads" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Threads:</h2><ul><li>A thread is an independent sequential path of execution within a program.</li><li>Many threads can run concurrently within a program</li><li>At runtime, threads in a program exist in a common memory space and can, therefore, share both data and code (i.e., they are lightweight compared to processes).</li><li>In Java, there are two types of threads: user threads and daemon threads</li></ul><h3 id="user-thread" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#user-thread" aria-hidden="true">#</a> User Thread:</h3><ul><li>User threads are created by application developers to perform specific tasks in the application.</li><li>They are often long-lived and perform tasks that the application requires to run.</li><li>The JVM waits for all user threads to complete their execution before it terminates.</li></ul><h3 id="daemon-threads" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#daemon-threads" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Daemon Threads:</h3><ul><li>Daemon threads are not considered user threads.</li><li>They are typically used for background tasks that can be interrupted, such as garbage collection or other housekeeping tasks.</li><li>The JVM can terminate even if daemon threads are still running.</li><li>Daemon threads in Java stop when: <ol><li>The daemon thread has completed execution of its run method.</li><li>All user threads have completed execution.
