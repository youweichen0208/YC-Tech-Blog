In C#, all the members of a class are sealed and cannot be redefined in the derived class. Use the <code>virtual</code> keyword with a member of the base class to make it overridable, and use the <code>override</code> keyword in the derived class to indicate that this member of the base class is being redefined in the derived class.</p><h4 id="rules-for-overriding" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#rules-for-overriding" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Rules for Overriding:</h4><ul><li>A method, property, indexer, or event can be overriden in the derived class.</li><li>Static methods cannot be overridden.</li><li>Must use virtual keyword in the base class methods to indicate that the methods can be overridden.</li><li>Must use the override keyword in the derived class to override the base class method.</li><li>Method overriding is a form of runtime polymorphism because the decision about which method to call is made at runtime based on the actual type of the object.</li></ul><h2 id="solid-principles" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#solid-principles" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Solid Principles</h2><p>Solid is an acronym for the five design principles.
