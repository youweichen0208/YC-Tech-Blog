What exactly is DP?</h3><p>In short, dynamic programming is optimized recursion. The arguments that a recursive function takes represents a state. When we looked at tree problems, we never visited a node more than once in our DFS, which means that a state can be repeated, usually an exponential number of times. To avoid repeating computation, we use something called memoization. When we find the answer (the return value) for a given state, we cache that value(usually in hashmap). Then in the future, if we ever see the same state again, we can just refer to the cached value without the needing to re-calculate it.</p><h3 id="_2-top-down-vs-bottom-up" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-top-down-vs-bottom-up" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2. Top-down vs. bottom-up</h3><h5 id="top-down" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#top-down" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Top-down:</h5><p>we start from the top(the original problem) and move down toward the base case. For example, we wanted the nth Fibonacci number, so we started by calling <code>fibonacci(n)</code>. We move down with recursion until we reach the base cases (<code>F(0)</code> and <code>F(1)</code>).</p><h5 id="bottom-up" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#bottom-up" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Bottom-up:</h5><p>In bottom-up, we start at the bottom (base cases) and work our way up to larger problems.</p><h3 id="_3-when-should-i-consider-using-dp" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-when-should-i-consider-using-dp" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 3.
