People often confuse &quot;database&quot; with &quot;database management systems&quot; (e.g. MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB, Snowflake). A database management system (DBMS) is the software that manages a database.</p><h4 id="_2-flat-file-strawman" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-flat-file-strawman" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2.

Database Management System</h4><p>A <strong>DBMS</strong> is a software that allows applications to store and analyze information in a database. A general-purpose DBMS is designed to allow the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases in accordance with some data model. A <strong>schema</strong> is a description of a particular collection of data based on a data model. This defines the structure of data for a data model. Withou a schema, we will have random bits with no meaning.</p><h4 id="_4-relational-model" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-relational-model" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 4. Relational Model</h4><p>A relation is an unordered set that contains the relationship of attributes that represent entities. Since the relationships are unordered, the DBMS can store them in any way it wants, allowing for optimization.</p><p>A tuple is a set of attribute values (also known as its domain) in the relation. In the past, values had to be atomic or scalar, but now values can also be lists or nested data structures. Every attribute can be a special value, NULL, which means for a given tuple the attribute is undefined.</p><p>A relation&#39;s primary key uniquely identifies a single tuple in a table. A foreign key specifies that an attribute from one relation maps to a tuple in another relation. Generally, the foreign key will point/be equal to a primary(unique <strong>more precisely</strong>) key in another table.</p><p>A constraint is a user-defined condition that must hold for any instance of the database. Unique key and referential (foreign key) constraints are the most common.</p><h2 id="device-driver-gpu-cpu-ssd-hdd" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#device-driver-gpu-cpu-ssd-hdd" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Device Driver, GPU, CPU, SSD, HDD,</h2><h4 id="_1-device-driver" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-device-driver" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 1.

Storage</h4><p>The primary storage location of DBMS database is on non-volatile disk(s). Volatile means that if we pull off the power form machine, then the data is lost. Non-volatile means the data won&#39;t be lost if the power is off. Since our DBMS architecture assumes that the database is stored on disk, the components of the DBMS are responsible for figuring out how to move data between non-volatile disk and volatile memory since the system cannot operate on the data direcly on disk.</p><h4 id="_2-disk-oriented-dbms-overview" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-disk-oriented-dbms-overview" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2. Disk-Oriented DBMS Overview</h4><p>The database is all on disk, and the data in database files is organized into pages, with the first page being the directory page. To operate on the data, the DBMS needs to bring the data into memory. It does this by having a buffer pool that manages the data movement back and forth between disk and memory. The DBMS has an execution engine that will execute queries. The execution engine will ask the buffer pool for a specific page, and the buffer pool will take care of bringing that page into memory and giving the execution engine a pointer to that page in memory. The buffer pool manager will ensure that the page is there while the execution engine operates on that part of memory.</p><h4 id="_3-dmbs-vs-os" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-dmbs-vs-os" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 3. DMBS vs OS</h4><p>A high-level design goal of the DBMS is to support databases that exceed the amount of memory availabl. Since reading/writing to disk is expensive, disk use must be carefully managed. We do NOT want large stalls from fetchign something from disk to slow down everything else. We want the DBMS to be able to process other queries while it is waiting to get the data from disk.</p><p>This high-level design goal is liek virtual memory, where there is a large address space and a place for the OS to bring in pages from disk.</p><p>One way to achieve this virtual memory is by using mmap to map the contents of a file in a process&#39; address space, which makes the OS responsible for moving pages back and forth between disk and memory.</p><h4 id="_4-file-storage" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-file-storage" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 4. File Storage</h4><p>In its most basic form, a DBMS stores a database as file on disk. Some may use a file hierarchy, others may use a single file (e.g., SQLite).</p><p>The OS does not know anything about the contents of these files. Only the DBMS knows how to decipher their contents, since it is encoded in a way specific to the DBMS.</p><p>The DBMS&#39;s storage manager is responsible for managing database&#39;s files. It represents the files as a collection of pages. It also keeps track of what data has been read and written to pages as well how much free space there is in these pages.</p><h4 id="_5-database-pages" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-database-pages" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 5. Database Pages</h4><p>The DBMS organizes the database across one or more files in fixed-size blocks of data called pages. Pages can contain different kinds of data(tuples, indexes. etc). Most systems will not mix these types within pages. Some systems will require that pages are self-contained, meaning that all the information needed to read each page is on the page itself.</p><p>Each page is given a unique identifier (page ID). If the database is a single file, then the page id can just be the file offset. A page ID could be unique per DB,S instance, per database, or per table. Most DBMSs have an indirection layer that maps a page id to a file path and offset. The upper levels of the system will ask for a specific page number. Then, the storage manager will have to turn that page number into a file and an offset to find the page. Most DBMSs uses fixed-size pages to avoid the engineering overhead needed to support variable-sized pages. For example, with variable-size pages, deleting a page could create a hole in files that the DBMS cannot fill with new pages.</p><p>There are 3 concepts of pages in DBMS:</p><ol><li>Hardware page (usually 4 KB)</li><li>OS page (4 KB)</li><li>Database page (1-16 KB)</li></ol><p>The storage device guarantees that an atomic write of the size of the hardware page. If the hardware page is 4 KB and the system tries to write 4 KB to the disk, either all 4 KB will be written, or none of it will. This means that if our database page is larger than our hardware page, the DBMS will have to take extra measures to ensure that the data gets written out safely since the program can get partway through writing a database page to disk when the system crashes.</p>',54),n=[o];function r(d,l){return a(),t("div",null,n)}const c=e(s,[["render",r],["__file","database systems.html.vue"]]);export{c as default};
