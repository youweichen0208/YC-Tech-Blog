DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our customers. A sign of a healthy DevOps practice is when everyone works together with a shared set of practices and tools. Essential DevOps practices include agile planning, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and monitoring of applications.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Continuous Integration (CI)</strong>: CI is practice of frequently merging code changes from multiple contributors into a main branch of a shared repository. Automated builds and tests are run to detect integration issues early. This allows teams to deliver software more rapidly while mitigating bugs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Continuous Delivery (CD)</strong>: CD is the natural extension of continuous integration, where code changes that pass the automated tests are automatically released into a production or staging environment. This enables frequent, low-risk software development and faster feedback loops.</p></li><li><p><strong>Containerization</strong>: Containerization is the packaging of software code along with its dependencies and configurations into a single image that can run consistently in different environments. Docker is the most popular containerization platform.</p></li></ul><h2 id="azure-container-apps" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#azure-container-apps" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Azure Container Apps:</h2><p>Azure Container Apps is a fully managed container service in Azure that allows us to build and deploy modern, containerized applications quickly and efficiently. It provides serverless computing experience, where we don&#39;t need to provision or manage any underlying infrastructure.</p><h2 id="azure-container-registry-acr" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#azure-container-registry-acr" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Azure Container Registry (ACR):</h2><p>Azure Container Registry is a private, managed container registry service provided by Azure.
