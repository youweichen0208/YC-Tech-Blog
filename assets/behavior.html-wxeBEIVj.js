The first one is the scalability. As the number of sensor increases, the data volumn grows exponentially. So we need to ensure the system grows as the sensor scales. The second one is the data velocity. The automated driving sensors generate data continously and at high speed. High data velocity requires the system with robust and efficient data streaming capacity. The last challenge of this problem is Automated driving systems generate a wide variety of data types, including structured data (like telemetry data with specific fields and formats) and unstructured data (such as video feeds and images) Each type of data requires different processing and categorization strategies. To solve that, we were using the Azure Event Hubs for real-time data ingestion. We designed a preprocessing layer to normalize data formats. For example, to normalize structured data like telemetry data, we convert data into common format like json, csv and we standardizing the naming conventions of fields. For the unstructured data such as images video feeds and images, we standardizing the file formats like converting all images to JPEG and resizing images or videos to a uniform resolution. After normalizing data, we use Azure Stream Analytics to categorize data streams based on content. The last part is the data storage, we use Azure blob storage for unstructured data like video feeds and Azure sql server for the structured telemetry data. With the team&#39;s colloboration and efforts, we not only implemented a scalable system that can analyze real-time data ingestion but also reduce the costs associated with data management and storage by 22%.</p><h2 id="tell-me-about-a-time-when-you-had-to-learn-a-new-technology-or-tool-to-complete-a-project" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tell-me-about-a-time-when-you-had-to-learn-a-new-technology-or-tool-to-complete-a-project" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Tell me about a time when you had to learn a new technology or tool to complete a project.</h2><h2 id="describe-a-situation-where-you-had-to-collaborate-with-a-difficult-team-member" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#describe-a-situation-where-you-had-to-collaborate-with-a-difficult-team-member" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Describe a situation where you had to collaborate with a difficult team member.</h2><h2 id="tell-me-about-a-time-when-you-had-to-handle-a-significant-change-or-unexpected-turn-of-events-in-a-project" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tell-me-about-a-time-when-you-had-to-handle-a-significant-change-or-unexpected-turn-of-events-in-a-project" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Tell me about a time when you had to handle a significant change or unexpected turn of events in a project?</h2><h2 id="can-you-describe-a-situation-where-you-had-to-make-a-problem-critical-decision-under-pressure" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#can-you-describe-a-situation-where-you-had-to-make-a-problem-critical-decision-under-pressure" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Can you describe a situation where you had to make a problem critical decision under pressure?</h2><h2 id="describe-a-situation-where-you-had-to-balance-multiple-tasks-at-once-how-did-you-prioritize" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#describe-a-situation-where-you-had-to-balance-multiple-tasks-at-once-how-did-you-prioritize" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Describe a situation where you had to balance multiple tasks at once.
